1. Battle actions

Each attack inflicts health damage 1 to 6, depending on dice rolls. The damage may be increased by attacker's strength.
You may automatically dodge an attack, depending on your dexterity.

2. Statistics

Health: You start with 50. Each attack deducts your health. You die at 0.
You may obtain potions to recover at Alchemy shop.

The following statistics are decided randomly [1-6].

- Strength: It decides how much damage your attack inflicts on enemy. Each strength level increases damage by 1, aside from basic attack damage [1-6]
ex) If an attack dice is 5 and your strength level is 3, you inflict 8 health damage.


- Dexterity: It decides the possibility of dodging attack, or succeeding attack.
If defender's dexterity is 6 and is higher than attacker, attacker may fail the attack with the 50% possibility.
If attacker's dexterity is 1 and is lower than defender, defender may dodge the attack with the 50% possibility.
Otherwise, attacks always succeed. When both have 6 or 1, these specials rules do not apply and attack always succeeds.


- Luck: It decides dice rolls. You may obtain lucky charms at Alechemy shop to increase your luck level.
Luck level 6 - the minimum value of each dice roll becomes 2, not 1.
Luck level 1 - the maximum value of each dice roll becomes 5, not 6.
